# Cookies widget - ePrivacy Directive consent
Simple cookie widget to web pages one notify users about policy of using their personal data

ePrivacy Directive consent text I'm took from https://www.privacypolicies.com/cookie-consent/

### Usage Example 
To connect the widget, you need to insert these 2 lines into the head tag:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://github.com/chezzyderp/cookie-widget/build/widget.min.css">
    <script src="https://github.com/chezzyderp/cookie-widget/build/widget.min.js">
#### Also you can 
Just download widget.min.js and widget.min.css from build folder and use them locally.
